# Predicting-Killer-Whale-Appearances
This is for my volunteer Org. Created model aims to predict the appearances of killer whales based on a comprehensive set of factors. 
To enhance the model's predictive power, new features have been engineered.

Key features include the range of start times, podcast rounds, geographical locations (US West, US East, Canada, Norway), seasonal information (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), historical periods (Early Studies, Captivity Boom, Conservation Era, Current Era), and podcast frequency.

The ultimate goal is to create a robust predictive tool that contributes to our understanding and forecasting of killer whale appearances, incorporating insights from various dimensions including temporal, geographical, and historical contexts.
